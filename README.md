Python Script Compiler by dds
A modern Windows GUI application for compiling Python scripts to bytecode (.pyc files).

Features
Modern GUI Interface: Clean, responsive interface built with tkinter
File Selection: Easy file browsing with drag-and-drop support
Output Directory: Customizable output location for compiled files
Real-time Feedback: Live compilation status and progress indication
Error Handling: Comprehensive error reporting with detailed messages
Threaded Compilation: Non-blocking compilation process
Output Logging: Detailed compilation logs and file information
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Windows operating system
No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)
Installation
Clone or download this repository
Ensure Python is installed on your system
No additional installation required - all dependencies are built-in
Usage
Running the Application
python python_compiler.py
How to Compile Python Scripts
Launch the Application: Run python_compiler.py
Select Input File: Click "Browse" to select a Python (.py) file
Choose Output Directory: Select where to save the compiled .pyc file
Compile: Click "Compile Python Script" button
Monitor Progress: Watch the progress bar and status updates
Review Output: Check the compilation log for details
Example
Select sample_script.py as input
Choose output directory (e.g., ./compiled/)
Click "Compile Python Script"
The application will create sample_script.pyc in the output directory

How It Works
The application uses Python's built-in py_compile module to:

Parse the Python source code for syntax errors
Compile the code to Python bytecode
Generate a .pyc file containing the compiled bytecode
Optimize the bytecode for faster execution
Benefits of Compiled Python
Faster Loading: .pyc files load faster than .py files
Syntax Validation: Compilation catches syntax errors early
Distribution: Compiled files can be distributed without source code
Performance: Slight performance improvement on subsequent runs
Error Handling
The application handles various error scenarios:

Syntax Errors: Invalid Python code is caught and reported
File Errors: Missing files or permission issues
Output Errors: Invalid output directories or write permissions
System Errors: Unexpected errors with full traceback
Technical Details
Compilation Process
Validation: Check if input file exists and is readable
Parsing: Python parser validates syntax
Bytecode Generation: AST is converted to bytecode
File Writing: Bytecode is written to .pyc file
Verification: Output file is verified and sized
GUI Features
Responsive Layout: Adapts to window resizing
Modern Styling: Clean, professional appearance
Progress Indication: Visual feedback during compilation
Status Updates: Real-time status messages
Error Dialogs: User-friendly error messages
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"No module named 'tkinter'"

Solution: Install Python with tkinter support
On some Linux systems: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
Permission Denied

Solution: Run as administrator or check file permissions
File Not Found

Solution: Ensure the Python file exists and path is correct
Output Directory Issues

Solution: Ensure output directory is writable
Performance Tips
Use SSD storage for faster compilation
Close other applications during large file compilation
Ensure sufficient RAM for large Python files
Development
Adding Features
The modular design makes it easy to extend:

Additional Output Formats: Support for other compilation targets
Batch Processing: Compile multiple files at once
Advanced Options: Compiler flags and optimization settings
Plugin System: Extensible architecture for custom features
